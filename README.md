# Jedha-Fullstack-Final-Project-Bloc-6

A data science (ML and Deployment) real-life experience project.

The chosen dataset represents the different work accidents in the different fields of activity in the United States.

Our objective is to predict the number of work accidents with lost time based on the field of activity and the number of other types of accidents to test Heinrich's pyramid.

We will then proceed to showing these results on a web dashboard.
